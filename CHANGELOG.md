Commander 1.0
=============
- Correction of the missing left fader when the adjustin comes from having the same left and right
value. O.K.

- The Orchestration editor now return to the first variation when it comes from a new patch,
instead of returning to the same. O.K.

- Correction of duplicated and/or swapped focused faders. O.K.

- Change to F1 the toggling midi State function... Reached

- Asgning to the toggling MIDI state the behavior of opening and closing the MIDI interface,
with the target of improving performance and avoiding laggings and surprising disconnections...
Reached, Thanks to GOD!

- Returning of the favourites patches. .O.K. Thanks to God!

- Exporting with :w rather than :export. .. Reached .. G.A.D.

- Auto closing MIDI device when exits ( if isnt closed yet ) O.K.

- First moving the Display Index rather than waits to the MIDI change O.K.

- Urge: Ventana variaci√≥n principal.

 Fixing of the columns in DisplayWindow

- Not to change to white when editing the instrument name of a track. This is produced because
the cursor color is always white. We have to improve that. (after the previous improvement
there will be no need to editig instrument name on Orchestration )

- Better track coloring

- Fix of no hiding Orchestration when shows Tagging

- WTF with the delete value mechanism??

Korg 4.7.3
==========

- A new Korg's paradigma prototype: The program now targets to a far-laptop scenario, where it is so difficult to read normal-sized console text, introducing an extensive use of the LCD characters. Now it features a SEARCH window, a PRE-CHOOSING (selected) song, and an ACTIVE (sended) song, all of them in a large-sized old-lcd style.

- Changed some keyboard shorcuts, improving security in the typewritting to avoid changing some system parameters (like VARIATION).

Korg 4.7.2
==========

- Complete redefining of the paradigma in the capture mechanism code: now all the engine was defined, structured, cleaned, and rebuilded in the main() function, disappearing the capture() function (even the 'capturing.c' file) and now uses a 'get_command()' function to improve legibility in the processors switch mechanism located on the main function.
- Delete of the full-displaying info of the track on LCDwindow, remaining just the song name.
- Bringing back of a newly redesigned COMPUTER window (previous development of this version located this two labels in the LCD window, just above the song name).

Korg 4.7.1
==========

- Introducing the VARIATION concept: Now each song contains TWO optional patches, indeeded to different orchestra configurations (e.g BRASS / NO BRASS, GUITAR / NO GUITAR, etc.)
- New Windows:
    *digitsWindow: Showing the bnk/num of the SELECTED patch (in real time)
    *computerWindow: Showing the variation1 / variation 2 state and the combinator / sequencer mode state.
- Returning of the digit-style song printing in the LCD display (*lcdWindow), displaying not the selected patch but the ACTIVE patch and containting more information such Genre, Section, etc.
    

Korg 4.7
========

- Complete restructuring of the software writing, achieveing a clearer structure and approaching to the C++ and Qt implementations of the korg/commander software.

Korg 4.6
========

- New data files manager based on commander 0.1: now the measures to counting rows are file-based instead of header-declarative.

Korg 4.5
========

- Redesigned interface based on commander 0.1
- Now the text-databased do not contain a space " " after the commas. This approachs to an eventually compatibilly with XML spreadsheets formats (like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice)

Korg 4.4
========

- New internal Ingeeniery in storaging data; now there are two databases: one for combinations and the other for sequences, rather than one swaped.

Korg-4.3
========

- Multiple source playlist construction: now you can add sequences and/or combinations to a single playlist. Change mode is now not playlist-destructive.

Korg-4.2
========
- Implementations of both modes MIDI system: now Korg sends Bank/Program Changes, Song Select commands, and/or pmidi/mplayer system() commands as requiered.
- Dissapear of the comb / seq buttons and reimplement inside the lcd window.
